# Entity-Framework-Core
The course details the work with the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) technology: Entity Framework Core (EF Core), which is a standard for ORM in C# and .NET Core applications. EF Core enables mapping between a relational database and an object-oriented model through the "database first" and "code first" approaches, providing a powerful object-oriented API for database queries and performing CRUD operations. EF Core offers both an additional level of abstraction and an easy way to handle data from the database.

The course will demonstrate established practices for building the database layer of complex systems in C# applications through built-in implementations of the Repository pattern and the use of the Service Layer. It will also cover importing and exporting data to various formats (JSON, XML).
